## üìù Next Steps (User Action Required)

### 1. Verify Secrets Configuration
Ensure the following secrets are configured in GitHub repository settings:

**Required for CI/CD:**
- `TESTNET_PRIVATE_KEY` - Wallet for Base Sepolia deployment
- `BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL` - RPC endpoint for Base Sepolia
- `BASESCAN_API_KEY` - BaseScan contract verification
- `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` - Frontend deployment
- `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` - Netlify site identifier

**Optional (for enhanced features):**
- `SONAR_TOKEN` - SonarCloud quality analysis
- `SNYK_TOKEN` - Snyk dependency scanning
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` - Slack notifications
- `DISCORD_WEBHOOK` - Discord notifications

### 2. Test Workflow Execution
Run workflows to verify updated actions work correctly:

```bash
# Test the CI/CD pipeline
gh workflow run ci-cd-pipeline.yml

# Test code quality checks
gh workflow run code-quality.yml -f task=full-scan

# Monitor execution
gh run watch
```

### 3. Review Workflow Logs
After first execution with updated actions:
- Check for deprecation warnings
- Verify artifact uploads succeed
- Confirm coverage reports generate
- Validate release creation (mainnet deployment)

## üõ°Ô∏è Rollback Plan

If issues arise with updated actions:

### Option 1: Revert Specific Action
```bash
# Example: Revert upload-artifact to v3
git diff HEAD~1 .github/workflows/ci-cd-pipeline.yml | grep upload-artifact
# Manually edit and revert to @v3
```

### Option 2: Full Rollback
```bash
# Revert to commit before updates
git revert <commit-hash>
git push origin main
```

### Option 3: Selective Rollback
Edit workflow files and change specific actions back to v3:
- Keep `codecov@v4` (provides significant improvements)
- Keep `softprops/action-gh-release@v1` (old action is deprecated)
- Revert `upload-artifact` to v3 if v4 causes issues
