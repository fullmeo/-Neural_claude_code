## ⚠️ Known Issues & Next Steps

### Critical (Fix Before Mainnet)
1. **PropheticSessionNFT.sol:76** - TokenId 0 collision
   - Documented in TEST_RESULTS.md
   - Fix: Add separate existence mapping
   - Priority: 🔴 HIGH

2. **Web3 Integration Incomplete**
   - Contract interactions are mocked
   - Need ethers.js implementation
   - Priority: 🔴 HIGH

### High Priority (Before Public Launch)
3. **Frontend Unit Tests** - Missing
4. **External Security Audit** - Recommended
5. **Monolithic HTML** - Split into components
6. **Bundle Size** - Optimize to <200KB

### Medium Priority (Post-Launch)
7. **TypeScript Migration** - Improve DX
8. **Service Worker** - Offline support
9. **Mobile Optimization** - Better UX
